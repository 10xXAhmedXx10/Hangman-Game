THE  GAME: it's a simpl letter game called hangman when you have to guess the right letters to save the man and for now they are only countries and some animals but I'm planning to add a lot more stuff than that like some human names, some food names etc...

THE STORY: I've made a story about a guy who has a lovely family Wife and Kids and he was working as a blacksmith and one day he got a call from out of town and on his way back he got lost in the desert so he had to leave his belongings because there were so  heavy and he faced some desert Bandits that decided to make his death more fun for them by playing Hangman game and that's where the player starts to save the man by guessing the letters

WHAT DID NOT WORK(bugs):  I have wrote a lot of CSS pages  & HTML but unfortunately I wasn't able to upload it to my game so that's one of Unsolved problem I need to fix also there is a weird bug sometimes happen when the player lose or win and decide to play again the game doesn't function start again and sometimes IT does which is weird so I'll take a look at it again in the near future

FUTURE PLANS:  what I'm planning to add it to the game other than the fixes that I mentioned is some back-end servers in the future so I don't have to make several HTML and CSS pages and just link them to one server page also I'm thinking about making more dynamic or animated background like something moves in the background maybe I'll put a moon or sun and clouds and trees you know some animation to the background and I will change the character "the hangman character" I'm planning to make him react or even move while he's in the hook-hang like he started shake when the player getting close to lose the game or freak out , and I'll style and animate the Bandit charactersas weel also I'm planning to write code that function hints that would help the player to know what kind of words or letters is that, is it a country or animal or food whatever

MY GOAL:  my goal in general for the near future when I come back to the game I'll make it as fun as possible for the player by adding some funny comments that the hangman would say or the Bandit just to give the game more comedy Style game then a horrible or tragedy because I don't want the player to feel bad when they lose.
